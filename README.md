Welcome to CTGP Revolution!

To make everything lovely and wonderful, extract the contents of this ZIP archive to the root of your SD card. Let everything merge and replace if it asks to. You also need to have a real Mario Kart Wii disc. Currently PAL (Europe/Australia), NTSC-U (America) and NTSC-J (Japan) discs are supported.

To launch CTGP Revolution, you must go via the CTGP Revolution Channel. To load the CTGP Revolution Channel, you have a few options.

If you already have a CTGP Revolution Channel, just launch that after extracting the files to the SD card.

If you have a Homebrew Channel, go in there and there will be a new Homebrew app waiting for you. Launch that and you are good to go.

If you had v1.02, or have Riivolution, you can use Riivolution to make the channel load. Assuming you have merged correctly, simply load Riivolution, set "CTGP Revolution Channel" to Enabled and then click Launch Game.

If you're a newcomer or without Homebrew, you will need to use Letterbomb/Bannerbomb/Smash Stack to make the channel manifest.

Once the Channel is running, it will explain the rest of the steps to you. When all is installed, simply click Launch Game on the CTGP Revolution Channel to make everything begin!

Those with My Stuff folders, they now reside at /ctgpr/My Stuff. If you have v1.02 on the SD card, the channel will move your My Stuff for you to the new location, or you can put it there yourself. 

Similarly, if you don't have a My Stuff folder, feel free to create one at /ctgpr/My Stuff. Right now, the Channel does not do that automatically.

And you can add music to the CTGP-R Channel by dropping MP3 files in /ctgpr/ChannelMusic.

Wiimmfi is automatically built in to the CTGP-R Channel. Using Wiimmfi, you can play online after Nintendo WFC shutdown, on both custom tracks, and on regular tracks.

If you run into trouble, more detailed instructions are available at http://chadsoft.co.uk/

Have fun!



Common problems and solutions:

If you can't install the CTGP Revolution Channel to the Wii menu, try removing the batteries from your Wii Remote as the installer begins, or if that fails, updating your Wii console.

If you find that your save data goes missing after running the CTGP, simply go into the Settings and turn "Save game on SD card" off.

If the CTGP Revolution Channel constantly declares "Please insert an SD card" even if there is one inserted, try running it via the Homebrew Channel instead of Riivolution.

If the CTGP Revolution Channel says the SD card has been ejected when you try to launch the game, please go to the Settings Menu, go to More Settings, and set SD Compatability Mode to ON.

If an update fails to download, feel free to get it from the Chadsoft website: http://www.chadsoft.co.uk/

If you don't have a "My Stuff" folder in /ctgpr/ when everything is done installing, make it yourself, the channel will know how to use it.

If the Channel always says "Note: CTWW is disabled" when you try to launch game, and you wish to play CTWW, please go to the Settings and set "Automatic Updates" to either "On" or "Verify Only".

If you get stuck in a loop where updates don't appear to be completing (getting to a certain percentage, throwing an error, then trying again over and over), delete the CTGP files from the SD card and download it again.

If the channel says "Could not load CTGP-R. Your pack may be corrupted.", put your SD in your computer, go into the ctgpr folder, and delete the file "jelly.bin". This normally solves the problem. If that doesn't work, redownload the pack.

If you get an "Exception (DSI) occurred!", try reloading to see if it goes away.

If you wish to use ghost data from your save file with CTGP, start the game with Custom Tracks off. Go to the Mario Kart Channel, go to Rankings, select a track, then select your Mii on the screen. When it shows your ghost data, it has been successfully copied to the SD card, and can then be used with CTGP. Please note that times dumped in this manner cannot be sent to the CTGP leaderboards, to prevent hacked times.
